# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This repository contains a complete end-to-end handwritten digit recognition project.

It includes:

- A web-based digit drawing tool (`index.html`)
- A Jupyter Notebook (`Neural Network.ipynb`) for training and evaluating a deep learning model using the MNIST dataset

---

##  Features

### Interactive Drawing Tool
A simple HTML and JavaScript interface for drawing digits (0–9).

### Data Preprocessing
The web app converts drawings into a 28×28 grayscale format suitable for MNIST models.

### Neural Network Training
The notebook includes:
- Loading the MNIST dataset  
- Normalizing the data  
- Building a TensorFlow/Keras neural network  
- Training and validating the model  

### Evaluation
Includes:
- Accuracy and loss metrics  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Predictions on sample digits  

### Custom Prediction
Predicts a custom handwritten digit (`digit (3).png`).
